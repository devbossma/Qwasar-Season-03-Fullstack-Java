Chat functionality (Part 01) + Desktop Interface with JavaFX (Part 02)
Part 01
Objective
Extend the coffee shop application to include a chat feature where customers can interact with baristas, place orders through chat, and save conversation history to a database using JDBC.

Project Overview
Chat Interface: Customers can send messages to baristas, ask questions, and place orders.

JDBC Integration: Store conversation history in a relational database.

Multithreading: Continue to support concurrent interactions.

Implementation Steps
1. Database Setup
Create a database and a table to store conversation history.
2. JDBC Configuration
Add JDBC dependencies to your pom.xml or build.gradle.
3. Database Utility Class
Create a utility class for managing database connections and operations.
4. Chat Class
Implement a chat class that allows customers to send messages.
5. CoffeeShop Class Modifications
Update the CoffeeShop class to handle incoming messages from the chat.
6. Main Application
Update the main application to launch the chat interface alongside barista threads.
Running the Application
1. Ensure your database is set up and running.
2. Update the database connection details in DatabaseUtil.
3. Compile and run your application as before (using Maven or Gradle).
4. Customers can enter messages and place orders by typing commands (e.g., "order cappuccino").
To enhance the coffee shop chat application with a desktop user interface, we can use JavaFX, which is a modern framework for building desktop applications in Java. JavaFX provides a rich set of UI controls and is suitable for creating a user-friendly chat application.

Part 02
Objective
Create a desktop application that allows users to:

View chat history.

Send new messages.

Upload and send photos.

Implementation Steps
1. Setup JavaFX
Ensure you have JavaFX set up in your project.
2. Create the Chat Interface
The JavaFX application part should have the following components:

A TextArea to display chat history.

A TextField for entering new messages.

A Button to send messages.

A Button to upload photos.

A ListView for showing uploaded images.

3. Update the Main Application Entry
Make sure to include JavaFX runtime arguments if necessary (e.g., for module path if you're using JDK 11 or above). Modify your main method to start the JavaFX application.
Summary of Features
Chat History Display: A TextArea shows the history of messages.

Send New Messages: Users can enter messages into a TextField and send them via a button.

Upload Photos: Users can select images to upload, which will be displayed in a ListView and stored in the database.

Running the Application
Ensure you have JavaFX configured properly in your project.

Update the DatabaseUtil class as needed to save image upload information.

Compile and run your application.

Additional Notes
Consider implementing a method to retrieve and display the full conversation history upon startup.

You can enhance the chat experience by adding more features, such as user authentication, emojis, or message formatting.

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and save files if you choose to upload images.
