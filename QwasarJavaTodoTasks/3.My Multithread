Multithreading in an Application context
Objective
Extend the coffee shop application to support multithreading, allowing multiple customers to place orders simultaneously and manage their requests concurrently.

Project Overview
In this enhanced coffee shop application, customers will place orders, and baristas will prepare those orders in a multithreaded environment. The application will showcase various multithreading concepts such as thread creation, synchronization, and managing shared resources.

Requirements
Core Features
Allow multiple customers to place orders concurrently.

Baristas (threads) will prepare orders in the background.

Implement a queue to manage incoming orders.

Notify customers when their orders are ready.

Demonstrate synchronization where necessary to ensure thread safety.

Classes to Implement
Customer: Represents a customer placing an order.

Barista: Represents a barista preparing orders.

Order: Represents an order placed by a customer.

OrderQueue: A thread-safe queue for managing orders.

CoffeeShop: Singleton to manage the coffee shop operations.

CoffeeFactory, Decorators, etc.: As previously defined.

Multithreading Concepts to Explore
Creating and managing threads using the Thread class and Runnable interface.

Synchronization techniques (e.g., using synchronized, ReentrantLock, etc.).

Producer-consumer problem using a thread-safe queue.

Notifying customers about order completion using the Observer pattern.

Implementation Steps
1. OrderQueue Class
Implement a thread-safe queue for managing orders.
2. Customer Class
Simulate customers placing orders in separate threads.
3. Barista Class
Simulate baristas preparing orders in separate threads.
4. CoffeeShop Class
Manage orders and synchronize access to the OrderQueue.
5. Main Application
Set up the main application to simulate customers and baristas.
Evaluation Criteria
Correct implementation of multithreading concepts in the coffee shop application.

Proper synchronization and management of shared resources.

Code quality and adherence to Java best practices.

Clarity and completeness of documentation.
