Design Patterns in an Application context
Objective
The application will simulate a coffee shop where customers can order different types of coffee and add various options.

Application Overview The coffee shop will allow customers to
Choose a type of coffee (e.g., Espresso, Cappuccino).

Add extras (e.g., milk, sugar) using the Decorator pattern.

Use a strategy for different pricing strategies based on customer loyalty.

Notify customers about their order status using the Observer pattern.

Create coffee types through a factory method.

Requirements
Create a Maven or Gradle project.

8. Facade Pattern
Implement a facade to simplify the coffee shop operations.
9. Prototype Pattern
Allow cloning of coffee orders.
10. Template Method Pattern
