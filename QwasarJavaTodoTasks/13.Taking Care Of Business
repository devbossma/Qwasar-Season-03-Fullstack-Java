Implementing CI/CD for a Microservice-based Application
Objective
Develop a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the previously created microservice-based travel booking application. This assignment will teach students how to automate testing, building, and deployment processes using Docker, Jenkins or Travis CI, Maven, code coverage tools, and cloud hosting services such as Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS.

Project Overview
Students will implement a CI/CD pipeline that includes building Docker images for each microservice, running tests, generating code coverage reports, and deploying the application to a cloud platform. This will involve setting up a version control system, configuring CI/CD tools, and ensuring automated deployment of their application.

Requirements
1. Project Structure
Use the existing travel booking microservice structure:

travel-booking/
|-- discovery-service/
|-- api-gateway/
|-- flight-service/
|-- hotel-service/
|-- car-rental-service/
|-- docker-compose.yml
|-- Jenkinsfile (or .travis.yml for Travis CI)
|-- README.md
2. Docker Configuration
Create a Dockerfile for each microservice.
Example Dockerfile for Flight Service

FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
COPY target/flight-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar flight-service.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/flight-service.jar"]
Create a docker-compose.yml file to manage the multi-container application.
Example docker-compose.yml

version: '3'
services:
  discovery-service:
    [...]
  
  api-gateway:
    [...]
  
  flight-service:
    [...]

  hotel-service:
    [...]

  car-rental-service:
    [...]
3. CI/CD Configuration
Choose between Jenkins or Travis CI for your CI/CD pipeline.
A. Jenkins Configuration
Create a Jenkinsfile at the root of your project.
Example Jenkinsfile

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            [...]
        }
        stage('Docker Build') {
            [...]
        }
        stage('Run Tests') {
            [...]
        }
        stage('Code Coverage') {
            [...]
        }
        stage('Deploy to Heroku') {
            [...]
        }
    }
}
B. Travis CI Configuration
Create a .travis.yml file.
Example .travis.yml:
language: java
jdk:
    [...]

services:
    [...]

script:
    [...]

after_success:
    [...]
4. Code Coverage Configuration
Integrate a code coverage tool like CodeCov or JaCoCo.
5. Cloud Deployment
Choose a cloud service like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS to host your application.
Configure deployment scripts in your CI/CD setup.
6. Unit Testing
Ensure that each microservice has unit tests implemented using JUnit.

Write meaningful tests for the core functionalities of each microservice.

7. Running the Application Locally
Use Docker Compose to run the entire application locally:
docker-compose up
