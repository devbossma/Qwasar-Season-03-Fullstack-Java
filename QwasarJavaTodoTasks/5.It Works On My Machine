Setting Up Tests with JUnit
Objective
Implement unit tests for the coffee shop application using JUnit. Learn best practices for writing tests, ensure code coverage, and understand the role of testing in software development.

Assignment Overview
Setup JUnit: Integrate JUnit into the coffee shop project.

Write Unit Tests: Create tests for various components of the application, at least:

Order processing.
Chat functionality.
Database interactions.
CoffeShop Singleton creation and lifecycle.
Measure Test Coverage: Use tools to measure the test coverage of the application.

Best Practices: Follow best practices for writing clean and effective tests.

Requirements
Project Structure: Ensure your project structure follows a standard format, including a separate directory for test classes:

JUnit Integration: For Maven or Gradle.

Test Class Creation: Write separate test classes for different components, such as:

OrderQueueTest
ChatTest
DatabaseUtilTest
CoffeeShopTest
Measuring Test Coverage
For IntelliJ
For Eclipse
For VScode
Best Practices for Testing
Isolation: Each test should be independent. Use mocks where necessary to isolate units.

Readability: Write clear and descriptive test names. Use comments to explain complex logic.

Coverage: Aim for high code coverage but focus on meaningful tests rather than just achieving a percentage.

Avoid Hardcoding: Use constants or enums for fixed values in tests to improve maintainability.

Setup and Teardown: Use @BeforeEach and @AfterEach to manage setup and teardown processes.

Evaluation Criteria
Completeness and correctness of tests.
Code coverage percentage and meaningful test cases.
Adherence to best practices in writing tests.
Clarity and organization of test code.
